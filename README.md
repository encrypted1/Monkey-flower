# Monkey-flower

Hey Everyone! 
 
I am new to coding and started studying Python a couple of months ago. I really enjoy it!! I would also like to venture into C++ and possibly other languages. I have worked with computers for quite some time (hardware and software for the most part) and just recently installed my first Linux distro, openSuse Leap 42.2. Don’t know why I waited so long. Looking forward to trying out a few things and see how things go.
